        If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.
        If False, only submits job.

        The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:

        * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,
        * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.

        .. warning::

            You cannot call ``PipelineResult.wait_until_finish`` method in your pipeline code for the operator
            to work properly. i. e. you must use asynchronous execution. Otherwise, your pipeline will
            always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
            `Asynchronous execution
            <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

        The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:

        * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
        * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.
          This loop checks the status of the job.

        Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
        pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
        steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
        to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
        to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.

        * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
        * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.

    :type wait_until_finished: Optional[bool]

    Note that both
    ``dataflow_default_options`` and ``options`` will be merged to specify pipeline
    execution parameter, and ``dataflow_default_options`` is expected to save
    high-level options, for instances, project and zone information, which
    apply to all dataflow operators in the DAG.

    It's a good practice to define dataflow_* parameters in the default_args of the dag
    like the project, zone and staging location.

    .. code-block:: python

       default_args = {
           'dataflow_default_options': {
               'zone': 'europe-west1-d',
               'stagingLocation': 'gs://my-staging-bucket/staging/'
           }
       }

    You need to pass the path to your dataflow as a file reference with the ``jar``
    parameter, the jar needs to be a self executing jar (see documentation here:
    https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/#self-executing-jar).
    Use ``options`` to pass on options to your job.

        If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.
        If False, only submits job.
        If None, default behavior.

        The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:

        * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,
        * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.

        .. warning::

            You cannot call ``PipelineResult.wait_until_finish`` method in your pipeline code for the operator
            to work properly. i. e. you must use asynchronous execution. Otherwise, your pipeline will
            always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
            `Asynchronous execution
            <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

        The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:

        * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
        * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.
          This loop checks the status of the job.

        Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
        pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
        steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
        to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
        to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.
    :type wait_until_finished: Optional[bool]

    It's a good practice to define dataflow_* parameters in the default_args of the dag
    like the project, zone and staging location.

    .. seealso::
        https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/rest/v1b3/LaunchTemplateParameters
        https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/rest/v1b3/RuntimeEnvironment

    .. code-block:: python

       default_args = {
           'dataflow_default_options': {
               'zone': 'europe-west1-d',
               'tempLocation': 'gs://my-staging-bucket/staging/',
               }
           }
       }

    You need to pass the path to your dataflow template as a file reference with the
    ``template`` parameter. Use ``parameters`` to pass on parameters to your job.
    Use ``environment`` to pass on runtime environment variables to your job.

    .. code-block:: python

       t1 = DataflowTemplateOperator(
           task_id='dataflow_example',
           template='{{var.value.gcp_dataflow_base}}',
           parameters={
               'inputFile': "gs://bucket/input/my_input.txt",
               'outputFile': "gs://bucket/output/my_output.txt"
           },
           gcp_conn_id='airflow-conn-id',
           dag=my-dag)

    ``template``, ``dataflow_default_options``, ``parameters``, and ``job_name`` are
    templated so you can use variables in them.

    Note that ``dataflow_default_options`` is expected to save high-level options
    for project information, which apply to all dataflow operators in the DAG.

        The value can contain different types:

        * If the value is None, the single option - ``--key`` (without value) will be added.
        * If the value is False, this option will be skipped
        * If the value is True, the single option - ``--key`` (without value) will be added.
        * If the value is list, the many options will be added for each key.
          If the value is ``['A', 'B']`` and the key is ``key`` then the ``--key=A --key-B`` options
          will be left
        * Other value types will be replaced with the Python textual representation.

        When defining labels (``labels`` option), you can also provide a dictionary.
    :type options: dict
    :param py_interpreter: Python version of the beam pipeline.
        If None, this defaults to the python3.
        To track python versions supported by beam and related
        issues check: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1251
    :type py_interpreter: str
    :param py_requirements: Additional python package(s) to install.
        If a value is passed to this parameter, a new virtual environment has been created with
        additional packages installed.

        You could also install the apache_beam package if it is not installed on your system or you want
        to use a different version.
    :type py_requirements: List[str]
    :param py_system_site_packages: Whether to include system_site_packages in your virtualenv.
        See virtualenv documentation for more information.

        This option is only relevant if the ``py_requirements`` parameter is not None.
    :param gcp_conn_id: The connection ID to use connecting to Google Cloud.
    :type gcp_conn_id: str
    :param project_id: Optional, the Google Cloud project ID in which to start a job.
        If set to None or missing, the default project_id from the Google Cloud connection is used.
    :type project_id: str
    :param location: Job location.
    :type location: str
    :param delegate_to: The account to impersonate using domain-wide delegation of authority,
        if any. For this to work, the service account making the request must have
        domain-wide delegation enabled.
    :type delegate_to: str
    :param poll_sleep: The time in seconds to sleep between polling Google
        Cloud Platform for the dataflow job status while the job is in the
        JOB_STATE_RUNNING state.
    :type poll_sleep: int
    :param drain_pipeline: Optional, set to True if want to stop streaming job by draining it
        instead of canceling during killing task instance. See:
        https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/stopping-a-pipeline
    :type drain_pipeline: bool
    :param cancel_timeout: How long (in seconds) operator should wait for the pipeline to be
        successfully cancelled when task is being killed.
    :type cancel_timeout: Optional[int]
    :param wait_until_finished: (Optional)
        If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.
        If False, only submits job.
        If None, default behavior.

        The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:

        * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,
        * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.

        .. warning::

            You cannot call ``PipelineResult.wait_until_finish`` method in your pipeline code for the operator
            to work properly. i. e. you must use asynchronous execution. Otherwise, your pipeline will
            always wait until finished. For more information, look at:
            `Asynchronous execution
            <https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#python_10>`__

        The process of starting the Dataflow job in Airflow consists of two steps:

        * running a subprocess and reading the stderr/stderr log for the job id.
        * loop waiting for the end of the job ID from the previous step.
          This loop checks the status of the job.

        Step two is started just after step one has finished, so if you have wait_until_finished in your
        pipeline code, step two will not start until the process stops. When this process stops,
        steps two will run, but it will only execute one iteration as the job will be in a terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method but pass wait_until_finish=True
        to the operator, the second loop will wait for the job's terminal state.

        If you in your pipeline do not call the wait_for_pipeline method, and pass wait_until_finish=False
        to the operator, the second loop will check once is job not in terminal state and exit the loop.
